      <h3>3. Personal Information Collected
      </h3>
      <p>"Personal Information" is information through which you can be identified. Providing your personal information to Ziply is your choice. Ziply maintains one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may keep such information indefinitely. Personal Information that Ziply may collect from you includes, but is not limited to your name, mailing address(es), telephone number(s), email address(es), birth date, bio, and any other information that you voluntarily provide. Personal Information you volunteer is used by Ziply for internal verification, to complete requested transactions, ensure appropriate legal use of the Services, provide you notification about updates to the Services, goods, and data, and to help provide you with technical support for the Services.
      </p>
      <p>Your Personal Information is collected from our Services, through email and/or through online applications (i.e., registration for a user account) you complete, our forums and message boards, blogs, entering sweepstakes and prize promotions, taking surveys, reporting problems and through any of your other activities with Ziply or on the Services. Personal Information that Ziply collects depends on the nature of your activities.

When you use our Services through a Third Party Platform, you authorize us to access, collect, store and use your Personal Information and account information stored or used by such Third Party Platform. You may, on some Third Party Platforms, be able to disable the sharing of such information with us, however, doing so may disable or limit your ability to use our Services on or through such Third Party Platform.</p>
      <p>ID Tokens – When you use the Services or any Third Party Platform, Ziply will assign a unique identifying token ("ID Token") which is used internally by Ziply and is not publicly displayed.

      <p>Ziply may also hire companies to help provide products or services, or any other third party that is needed to assist in the completion of transactions you request. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these third parties.</p>
      <p>Ziply may also work with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you. Your opt-out of receiving information from us and/or third parties will not apply to sharing by Ziply of your Personal Information with any of these third parties. Nonetheless, except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these third parties are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described herein or as required by law.</p>
      <p>Ziply may make forums, chat rooms and other community services available to you on the Services. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. When you disclose such information in a forum, message board, chat room or any other public forum, you do so at your own risk. Ziply has no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information or any other information about yourself. The information presented in these areas reflects the views of the individual users or hosts and does not necessarily reflect the views of Ziply or any of its affiliates. Ziply reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to monitor the use of forums, chat rooms or other public forums on the Services, including those available on Third Party Platforms.</p>
      <p>Ziply may also disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information: (1) in response to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants, or orders served on or delivered to Ziply; (2) if needed, as determined in Ziply's sole discretion, to protect Ziply's rights or property, to enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy and/or Ziply's Terms of Use, and/or to prevent harm to yourself or others; and (3) if Ziply or its business is sold or offered for sale to another entity or individual(s), a petition for relief is filed under U.S. Bankruptcy laws for or against Ziply, or if Ziply becomes subject to an order of appointment of a trustee or receiver.</p>
      <p>Ziply reserves the right to release and/or use all information contained within our databases, access logs or other records concerning you if you violate this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or other rules, policies, notices, agreements or guidelines, or intentionally or unintentionally partake (or are reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, including, but not limited to, hacking, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law, and/or to initiate our own legal proceedings. Ziply cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using the Services for illegal activities. Ziply also reserves the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement individuals or entities for investigation or prosecution.</p>
      <p>Ziply may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your Personal Information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the Personal Information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. In the event that we sell a business, we will attempt to include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy. Thus, any of your opt out requests will not affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. Ziply also reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of Ziply's assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Ziply may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of Ziply to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and Ziply may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any manner in Ziply's sole discretion.</p>
      <h3>5. Opt Out</h3>

      <p>Ziply may also use your Personal Information, or a portion thereof, to send you marketing materials, channel and/or show information, vendors with information that you may need, and/or Ziply newsletters or advertisements, unless you notify Ziply that you do not wish to receive such materials.

      <p>Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Services that contains the material that you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must provide us with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the alleged infringing material(s), so that we can comply with your request to remove or deny access to it/them.;</p>

      <p>The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;</p>
      <p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
      <p>A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information contained in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice will not be valid. You must submit any notification of an alleged copyright infringement to Ziply’s DMCA Agent by email as set forth below:</p>
